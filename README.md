This is the final project for ECE241, its a game written entirely in Verilog. The spaceships are going to collect the incoming stars and avoid getting hit by commet.
The sprites and numbers on the scoreboard are drawn on miscrosoft paint and save it as a MIF file before displaying on the VGA display.
